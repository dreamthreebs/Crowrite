### Astrometry
Astrometry in the context of radio astronomy refers to the branch of astronomy that involves the precise measurement of the positions and movements of celestial objects. When you mention having a catalog from some radio observations, it implies that this catalog likely contains astrometric data—specifically, the positions, and possibly the proper motions (movement across the sky) and parallaxes (distances based on apparent shifts due to Earth's orbit around the Sun) of celestial sources as observed in the radio spectrum.

Here’s a breakdown of what astrometry encompasses, particularly in radio observations:

Positional Accuracy: Radio astrometry focuses on determining the exact celestial coordinates (right ascension and declination) of objects such as stars, galaxies, quasars, pulsars, and other radio sources. The accuracy of these measurements can be extremely high, often to milliarcsecond precision or better, thanks to techniques like Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).

Proper Motions and Parallaxes: By observing the same objects at different times, astrometrists can calculate their proper motions (how they move across the sky) and parallaxes (which help in determining distances from Earth). This is crucial for understanding the dynamics and structure of our galaxy and the universe.

Reference Frames: Radio astrometry contributes to the establishment and maintenance of celestial reference frames. These frameworks are essential for navigation (both terrestrial and spaceborne) and for ensuring consistency and accuracy in astronomical measurements over time.

Link to Other Wavelengths: Radio astrometry can be linked with optical astrometry and observations in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is important for cross-verifying observations and for studies that require data from multiple wavelengths to understand the physics of celestial objects.

Applications: The data in your radio observation catalog can be used for various scientific investigations, such as studying the kinematics of the Milky Way, tracking the motion of nearby galaxies, understanding stellar formation, and testing theories of gravity and general relativity.

In summary, if you have a catalog from radio observations containing astrometric data, it contains precise measurements of the positions and possibly the motions of radio-emitting celestial objects. This data is critical for a wide range of astronomical research and has practical applications in navigation and space science.
