## Galactic cold Clump [ CMB | POINT SOURCE ]

Galactic cold clumps are fundamental components of galaxies, serving as the birthplaces of stars and playing a critical role in the ongoing process of galactic evolution and star formation. Their study offers valuable insights into the complex interplay of processes that govern the lifecycle of galaxies.

The difference between warm dust and cold dust in the frequency spectrum primarily lies in the peak emission wavelength, which is determined by their temperatures according to Wien's displacement law. This law states that the peak wavelength of emission from a black body (an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation) is inversely proportional to its temperature. Thus, warmer objects emit most of their radiation at shorter wavelengths, while cooler objects emit at longer wavelengths.
