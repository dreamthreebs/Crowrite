In Python, both `classmethod` and `staticmethod` are used to define methods that are not dependent on the instance state of a class. However, they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios:

### `classmethod`
- **Definition**: A `classmethod` is a method that receives the class itself as the first argument instead of the instance. It is denoted by the `@classmethod` decorator.
- **Usage**: It is used when you need to access or modify the class state that applies across all instances of the class, or when you want to instantiate an object of the class in different ways.
- **Access to class attributes**: Can modify class state that applies across all instances.

Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    count = 0

    @classmethod
    def increment_count(cls):
        cls.count += 1
```

### `staticmethod`
- **Definition**: A `staticmethod` does not receive an implicit first argument (neither `self` nor `cls`). It is defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.
- **Usage**: Useful when you need to perform a function that doesn't interact with the class or instance properties but makes sense to include within a class (usually for utility purposes).
- **Access to class attributes**: Cannot access or modify class state directly.

Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def utility_function(x, y):
        return x + y
```

### Key Differences
- **Binding**: `classmethod` binds to the class, not the instance, so it can modify class state. `staticmethod` does not bind to either and acts like a regular function that happens to reside in a class's namespace.
- **Arguments**: `classmethod` automatically takes the class (`cls`) as the first argument. `staticmethod` does not take `self` or `cls` as arguments.

These differences make `classmethod` suitable for scenarios where the method needs to interact with the class itself, while `staticmethod` is used for utility tasks that do not need to interact with class or instance data.
