## BRAINSTORM

### inpainting for what?
* reconstruct the CMB to estimate the powerspectrum
* remove non-Gaussion element on the map

### point source removal importance

different sky fraction has different foreground, maybe our sky is more contaminated, so the bias caused by point source might be large.

### advantage versus inpainting?
robust, more easy to realize, 

## BICEP setup [ CMB ]
Beamwidths for the three frequencies in the BK15 dataset are roughly 0.305° (43′ FWHM, 95 GHz), 0.210° (30′ FWHM, 150 GHz), and 0.141° (20′ FWHM, 220 GHz).
