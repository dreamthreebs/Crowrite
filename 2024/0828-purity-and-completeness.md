# 0828-purity and completeness

### CMB

### Purity

(less bad points) this is because some fake signal would be inside the point sources identification.

The definition of purity is $$1-\frac{N_{\text{fp}}}{N_R}$$, $$N_{\text{fp}}$$ is false positive number. $$N_{R}$$ is the number of recovered point source.

### Completness

(input should all be included)

The definition of completeness is $$\frac{N_I}{N_{R}}$$, $$N_{I}$$ is the input pointr source number. $$N_{R}$$ is the number of recovered point source.
