### POINT SOURCES REMOVING:
Goal: Get the point sources parameter (Q and U) precisely, then it would be nice to remove it.

I can try this on Q,U maps or on some other filtered map?

The key point to get precise point sources parameter is to increase the signal to noise level and use as much as possible the information of point sources itself and also you have to know the information or property of other compoments on the maps, such as foreground, CMB, and instrumental noise and so on.

What to do? Try filterting on QU maps, maybe it is best to try on QbUb maps and try to filter it.

First, have a look on are point sources still ok on QbUb maps.

then try to make some filtering on that.
