### 原初引力波探测中点源处理的新方法及其基准测试

Point sources, such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), are a significant source of foreground contamination that can mimic or obscure the true B-mode signal in CMB polarization data. To address this, various strategies like masking, inpainting, and direct subtraction have been employed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In our work, we introduce a new method for evaluating flux density and directly subtracting point sources from CMB maps, aiming to improve the accuracy of B-mode polarization analysis and deepen our understanding of the early universe's dynamics. We performed benchmark tests, comparing our method with traditional masking and inpainting techniques at the power spectrum level on B-mode maps. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms the others, making it a promising approach for future data analysis.

密度扰动（标量模式）由于对称性，仅能产生无旋的E模偏振；而引力波（张量模式）会引起时空的扭曲和旋转，从而打破对称性，生成B模偏振。
