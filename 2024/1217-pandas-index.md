# 1217-pandas index

Yes, **`df.loc` index range** in pandas behaves **differently** compared to Pythonâ€™s standard slicing for lists or arrays.

***

#### **Key Difference**: **Inclusive Behavior**

* In **Python slicing** (e.g., lists, arrays), the end index is **exclusive**.
* In **pandas `df.loc`**, both the start and the end indices are **inclusive**.

***

#### Example: Python List Slicing

```python
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

Here:

* `1:4` **excludes** the element at index `4`.

***

#### Example: pandas `df.loc` Slicing

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a simple DataFrame
data = {'A': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

# Use .loc slicing
print(df.loc[1:3])
```

**Output:**

```
    A
1  20
2  30
3  40
```

Here:

* `1:3` in `df.loc` **includes** the row at index `3`.

***

#### Why This Happens:

* `df.loc` works with **label-based indexing**, and the label at the end of the range is explicitly included.
* This design choice makes it easier to include both ends of the range without calculating offsets.

***

#### Summary:

| Feature       | Python Slicing (Lists) | `df.loc` in pandas       |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Index Range   | Exclusive end          | Inclusive end            |
| Example `1:3` | Includes indices 1, 2  | Includes indices 1, 2, 3 |

If you want **Python-like behavior** in pandas, use **`iloc`**, which is positional and exclusive:

```python
print(df.iloc[1:3])  # Output: rows with indices 1 and 2
```
