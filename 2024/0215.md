### MBTI(Myers–Briggs Type Indicator)
Myers and Briggs devised the following categories to describe character: individuals are either (1) introvert (I) or extrovert (E); (2) driven by intuition (N) or sensation (S); (3) a thinker (T) or a feeler (F); and (4) you are either a planner who wants to draw conclusions (Judge), or are you more comfortable in a chaotic en- vironment and want to keep things open (Perceiver).
