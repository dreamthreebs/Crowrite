## QUIJOTE \[ CMB ]

The QUIJOTE (Q-U-I JOint Tenerife) CMB Experiment is designed to observe the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background and other Galactic and extragalactic signals at medium and large angular scales in the frequency range of 10–40 GHz. The first of the two QUIJOTE telescopes and the multi-frequency (10–20 GHz) instrument have been in operation since November 2012. In 2014 a second telescope and a new instrument at 30 GHz will be ready for commissioning, and an additional instrument at 40 GHz is in its final design stages. After three years of effective observations, the data obtained by these telescopes and instruments will have the required sensitivity to detect a primordial gravitational-wave component if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is larger than r = 0.05. At the moment, we have completed half of the wide Galactic survey with the multi-frequency instrument covering 18 000 square degrees of the northern hemisphere. When we finish this survey in early 2014, we shall have reached ∼ 14μK per one degree beam at 11, 13, 17 and 19 GHz, in both Q and U.

Phase I. A first QUIJOTE telescope (QT1) and multi-frequency instrument (MFI), see Figure 1, are in operation since November 2012 with a frequency coverage between 10 and 20 GHz. A second instrument (TGI) with 31 polarimeters working at 30 GHz is expected to start operations in spring 2014. A 30 GHz two-element interferometer will monitor and correct the contribution of polarized radio-sources in the final QUIJOTE maps.

Phase II. A second QUIJOTE telescope (QT2) and a third instrument (FGI) with 40 polarimeters working at 40 GHz being designed.

Each primary mirror has a 2.25 m projected aperture, while the secondary has 1.89 m.

### Core science

B mode, synchrotron and AME

1. Cosmological Survey: deep survey covering ∼ 3 000 deg2 of the sky. Here, we shall reach sensitivities of ∼ 5 μK per one degree beam after two years of effective observing time with the MFI (11–19 GHz), and . 1 μK per beam with TGI and FGI at 30 and 40 GHz. At the moment we have accumulated ∼ 1200 hours of observing time in these fields.
2. Wide Galactic Survey: shallow survey covering 18 000 deg2 of sky. Half of the survey was completed between April and July with the MFI (11–19 GHz), see Fig. 2. In the next months we will repeat the observations increasing the integration time a factor 2, reaching sensitivities of ∼14 μK per one degree beam in the Stokes Q and U maps. In the future, a similar survey will be conducted with the TGI and FGI, expecting to reach sensitivities of . 3 μK per beam.

## MEMO

A detailed knowledge of this lensing induced signal will allow us to probe dark energy parameters, absolute neutrino mass, and even to reconstruct a projected mass map of the LSS.

## WHY

### why we always use small aperture telescope to detect primordial B mode?

Because one telescope cannot detect in a high precision in both large scale and small scale. If you want to detect large scale you need to cover a large area of the sky, However it is hard for large aperture tescope to move so fast and cover a big sky fraction. Another thing we need to know is the atmosphere effect, the atmosphere will cause large contamination on large scale and might dominate the signal.
