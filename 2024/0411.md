The masks described in this appendix are used in the papers on cosmological parameters (Planck Collaboration XIII 2016), inflation (Planck Collaboration XX 2016), dark energy (Planck Collaboration XIV 2016), and primordial magnetic fields (Planck Collaboration XIX 2016), which are notable examples of the application of the high-\` likelihood. However, the masks differ from those adopted in some of the other Planck papers. For example, reconstructions of gravitational lensing (Planck Collaboration XV 2016) and integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (Planck Collaboration XXI 2016), constraints on isotropy and statistics (Planck Collaboration XVI 2016), and searches for primordial non-Gaussianity (Planck Collaboration XVII 2016) mainly rely on the high-resolution foreground-reduced CMB maps presented in Planck Collaboration IX (2016). Those maps have been derived by four component-separation methods that combine data from different frequency channels to extract “cleaned” CMB maps.
