the binned power spectrum values are referred to as bandpowers.

It is often more convenient to work with the lensingmass (convergence) field Îº since the lensing potential has a red spectrum while the lensing-mass field has a nearly flat spectrum

In the main line analysis for tensor-to-scalar ratio r (BK-I, BK-VI, BK-X, BK-XIII), the most fundamental guard against systematics are the map jackknife (or null) tests. Maps are made splitting the data into (approximate) halves according to criteria which would be expected to result in nearly equal signal, but potentially different systematic contamination. The split maps are then differenced and the EE, BB and EB spectra of the result compared to simulations of signal plus noise. Well chosen jackknife splits can amplify systematics which cancel in the full coadd map (BK-III). It must be emphasized again that the published BK measurements of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, including the latest BK18 release, have passed all these null tests.

Since the telescope is constantly scanning the sky, a time-varying spurious systematic effect will translate into a position-dependent error in the map, which can be associated with different distortions.

Variations of the actual absolute calibration values between detectors can translate into spatial amplitude modulation of the coadded maps. This amplitude variation could also be introduced by bandpass mismatches (BK-II) between pairs of detectors.
