To mitigate the lensing biases from point sources and galaxy clusters, we can remove them in map space using a combination of source inpainting and masking.

The inpainting process replaces the pixels around the source with samples drawn from a Gaussian random field with power spectrum consistent with that of the CMB. The samples are constrained to have correlations with the surrounding pixels that follow the predicted CMB correlation function

For source masking, we multiply the map with a mask that effectively zeroes the source pixels using cosine tapers, which smoothly decrease from 1 to 0, following the shape of a cosine curve. Masking holes introduce a mean field that can be estimated using simulations and subtracted from the lensing map

To reduce the mean field and its associated uncertainties, we inpaint most of the sources and mask bright ones that are above 50 mJy at 150 GHz.
