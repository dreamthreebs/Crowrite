## CROW
what is the model of point sources. (beam profile, effective beam? and what is the variance in the chi square.(CMB+NOISE?)) \
what do point sources catalog have in their data. how to consider its variability? \
why not using different ways to estimate the phetometry? \

## MEMO
the method to reduce the ILC bias.(The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: High-resolution component-separated maps across one-third of the sky. arxiv:2307.01258)
