The purpose of a foreground mask is to exclude map pixels that contain “too much” foreground signal from use in CMB analyses. Some pixels often need to be masked even after a foreground reduction technique has been applied to a map. What constitutes “too much” foreground signal depends on the particular analysis. It is therefore useful to have masks available with different flux cut-off levels. For example, these masks can be used to demonstrate (in)sensitivity of scientific results to the level of foreground sky cut
