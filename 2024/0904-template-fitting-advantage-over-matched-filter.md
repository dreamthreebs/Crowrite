# 0904-template fitting advantage over matched filter

### BRAINSTORM

TF can consider the situation when point sources that are overlapped.

let foreground be background offset, only consider CMB and noise because they are more gaussian variable whereas diffuse foreground not.&#x20;

We expect the flux density parameter's error not to change too much as the adding of diffuse foreground.
