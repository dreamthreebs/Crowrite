## PAPER

### The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR5 maps of 18 000 square degrees of the microwave sky from ACT 2008-2018 data

Only one of the âˆ¼ 20 point sources (red dots) we see in ACT panels can be seen in Planck, and none of the clusters (blue dots, three visible without filtering).

#### what is stacking mean in thermal SZ and kinematic SZ cluster stacking
In the context of galaxy clusters and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, "stacking" refers to a technique used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of observations by combining data from multiple clusters. This method is particularly useful when the signal from individual clusters might be too weak to detect or analyze in detail.

## MEMO
what is the thing that I concern most in the experiment?

beam, noise level, IQU or EB?

datasets
