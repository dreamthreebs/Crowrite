### Active Galaxies and AGN
Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN):
An AGN is a compact region at the center of an active galaxy. It is powered by a supermassive black hole that is millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun. The black hole's immense gravitational pull attracts surrounding gas and dust, forming an accretion disk. As material in the accretion disk spirals inward, it heats up and emits vast amounts of energy.

Key Features of AGN:

Relativistic Jets: Some AGNs produce powerful jets of charged particles that travel at nearly the speed of light. These jets can extend thousands of light-years into space.
Synchrotron Radiation: Electrons in the jets emit synchrotron radiation as they spiral around magnetic field lines. This radiation is a key feature of AGNs and can be observed across various wavelengths.
Broad and Narrow Emission Lines: The spectra of AGNs often show broad and narrow emission lines, which are produced by gas moving at high velocities near the black hole.
Variability: AGNs can vary in brightness over timescales ranging from hours to years, reflecting changes in the accretion rate or other dynamic processes near the black hole.
Types of AGNs:

Quasars: Extremely luminous AGNs that can outshine their host galaxies.
Seyfert Galaxies: A class of active galaxies with bright nuclei and strong emission lines.
Blazars: A type of AGN with jets pointed almost directly at Earth, making them appear exceptionally bright and variable.
Understanding AGNs is crucial for studying the evolution of galaxies and the role of supermassive black holes in the universe.

### Type of AGN
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are categorized based on their observational characteristics, which are influenced by factors such as the orientation of the AGN relative to the observer, the presence of jets, and the properties of the surrounding material. Here are the main types of AGNs:

1. Quasars
Definition: Quasars (quasi-stellar objects) are the most luminous type of AGN. They can outshine their host galaxies and are visible across vast distances.
Characteristics:
Extremely high luminosity.
Broad emission lines in their spectra.
Strong radio emissions in some cases (radio-loud quasars).
Significant redshift, indicating they are very distant and thus seen as they were in the early universe.
2. Seyfert Galaxies
Definition: Seyfert galaxies are a class of active galaxies with bright nuclei and strong emission lines. They are less luminous than quasars but still much brighter than normal galaxies.
Characteristics:
Divided into two types: Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2.
Seyfert 1: Show both broad and narrow emission lines, indicating high-velocity gas close to the black hole.
Seyfert 2: Show only narrow emission lines, suggesting that the broad-line region is obscured by dust and gas.
Often found in spiral galaxies.
3. Blazars
Definition: Blazars are a type of AGN with jets pointed almost directly at Earth, making them appear exceptionally bright and variable.
Characteristics:
Divided into two subtypes: BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and Optically Violent Variables (OVVs).
BL Lacs: Feature weak or no emission lines and are dominated by non-thermal emission.
OVVs: Show strong and variable optical emission lines.
Exhibit rapid variability in brightness.
Strong polarization and high-energy emissions (X-rays and gamma rays).
4. Radio Galaxies
Definition: Radio galaxies are AGNs that emit large amounts of radio waves, often associated with large-scale jets and lobes.
Characteristics:
Divided into two types based on their radio morphology: Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) and Fanaroff-Riley type II (FR II).
FR I: Have jets that fade with distance from the core.
FR II: Have bright hotspots at the ends of their jets.
Often found in elliptical galaxies.
5. LINERs (Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions)
Definition: LINERs are a type of AGN with spectra dominated by low-ionization emission lines.
Characteristics:
Less luminous than Seyfert galaxies and quasars.
Emission lines suggest lower ionization states of gas.
Common in both spiral and elliptical galaxies.
Summary
AGNs are diverse and can be classified into several types based on their luminosity, spectral characteristics, and the orientation of their jets. Understanding these types helps astronomers study the different mechanisms powering these energetic phenomena and their impact on galaxy evolution.
