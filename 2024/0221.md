### Statistical properties of polarized radio sources at high frequency and their impact on CMB polarization measurements [ARXIV:1003.5846](https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5846)

* the median level of fractional polarization is around 2 − 2.5 per cent and there is no evidence for any dependence on frequency in the range 8.4 to 43 GHz;
* if one is to detect r ∼ 0.01 some source mitigation strategy will be required at all frequencies.
* There is one final point we should make. Many of the sources, particularly those with high flux densities, are expected to be significantly variable. This will manifest itself not only in variable total and polarized flux densities, but also in the polarization position angle. This could make it difficult to subtract the effects of source confusion from the CMB polarization signal. If the observations of a particular CMB field are performed over a timescale which is shorter than the timescale of variability, this will require the high resolution observations performed to assist source subtraction to take place contemporaneously in order to make an accurate subtraction. Conversely, if the timescale for observations is longer than the variability, for example, if observations on a particular region are built up a series of short integrations over many days, then the variability of the source polarization could easily average out to a significantly lower observed polarization when the individual integrations are stacked. This effect will make accurate source subtraction difficult since it is likely to be impractical to monitor the level of variability for a substantial number of sources.
