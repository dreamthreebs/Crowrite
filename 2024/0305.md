### Filling in CMB map missing data using constrained Gaussian realizations [Bucher 2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0286)

According to the simplest inflationary models, the primordial cosmological perturbations should be very nearly Gaussian.

inflationary models do exist predicting levels of non-Gaussianity that will be measurable with the Planck space mission and other new data sets.

> In this paper we instead consider filling in by means of constrained Gaussian realizations. Under this approach it is assumed that the power spectrum can be characterized sufficiently well based on the data from the unmasked pixels.
