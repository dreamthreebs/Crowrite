# 1020-compare different method pipeline

1. Extract diffuse foreground power spectrum from partial sky (compare it with other component)
2. Find out threshold in T maps
3. Generate point sources simulation from previous threshold
4. Do template fitting for pcfn simulations and n simulations
5. Check goodness of fit.
6. Produce template fitting after maps on QU
7. Do inpainting (generate input by recycling method first)
8. Power spectrum estimation&#x20;
