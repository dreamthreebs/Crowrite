## Review of the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect

### Introduction: The Cosmic Microwave Background and Secondary Anisotropies

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, a relic of the early universe emitted approximately 400,000 years after the Big Bang, stands as a cornerstone of modern cosmology.<sup>1</sup> At a time when the universe was significantly hotter and denser, the emission of the CMB marked a crucial epoch. The CMB exhibits a spectrum that is remarkably close to a perfect blackbody, with its uniformity measured to an extraordinary precision of one part in 100,000.<sup>2</sup> This near-perfect homogeneity makes even minute distortions in the CMB spectrum highly significant and detectable, offering valuable insights into the universe's evolution after this initial epoch.

Beyond the primary anisotropies imprinted at the time of recombination, the CMB photons undergo further interactions as they traverse the universe. These interactions with intervening matter give rise to what are known as secondary anisotropies.<sup>3</sup> Unlike the primary anisotropies, which reflect the conditions of the early universe, secondary anisotropies carry information about the large-scale structure and the evolution of the cosmos at later times. These subtle alterations to the CMB provide a unique window into the processes that have shaped the universe we observe today.

Among the various forms of secondary anisotropies, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect stands out as a key phenomenon. This effect arises from the scattering of CMB photons by high-energy electrons present in the intervening plasma.<sup>4</sup> The SZ effect offers a distinctive method for probing the hot, ionized gas that permeates the universe. The interaction between the low-energy CMB photons and the energetic electrons in hot plasma leaves a characteristic spectral signature, allowing scientists to identify and study these regions of hot gas.

The SZ effect is broadly categorized into two main components: the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect.<sup>1</sup> The tSZ effect is sensitive to the random thermal motions of the electrons within the hot gas, while the kSZ effect is caused by the bulk motion of the scattering medium, such as the overall movement of a galaxy cluster. Separating these two effects allows for the investigation of different physical properties of the intervening plasma. The tSZ effect, by revealing information about the temperature and pressure of the electron gas, and the kSZ effect, by providing insights into its velocity relative to the CMB rest frame, offer complementary perspectives on the state and dynamics of cosmic structures. This report will primarily focus on the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, which is generally the more dominant of the two in galaxy clusters.<sup>8</sup>

### Defining the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect

The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect is precisely defined as a small spectral distortion observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum.<sup>4</sup> This distortion is a consequence of the modification of the energy distribution of CMB photons as they interact with energetic electrons. The fundamental physical process underlying the tSZ effect is the inverse Compton scattering of low-energy CMB photons by high-energy, or hot, electrons.<sup>5</sup> In this scattering process, energy is transferred from the high-energy electrons to the low-energy photons, resulting in an average energy boost for the CMB photons.

The primary source of these high-energy electrons is the hot ionized gas found predominantly in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters.<sup>3</sup> Galaxy clusters, being the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, possess deep gravitational potential wells that heat the infalling gas to extremely high temperatures, typically millions of degrees Kelvin. This heating results in a large population of high-energy electrons within the ICM, making galaxy clusters the most prominent sites for observing the tSZ effect. When CMB photons pass through the ICM, they encounter these energetic electrons, leading to the inverse Compton scattering that characterizes the tSZ effect.

A key feature of the tSZ effect is the characteristic spectral distortion it imprints on the CMB. This distortion manifests as a decrease in the intensity of the CMB at frequencies below approximately 218 GHz and an increase in intensity at frequencies above this value.<sup>1</sup> This unique spectral signature is crucial for identifying and separating the tSZ effect from other signals present in CMB observations. The exact crossover frequency can be slightly influenced by relativistic corrections, which become important for the most massive and hottest galaxy clusters.

Remarkably, the magnitude of the tSZ effect is independent of the redshift of the galaxy cluster.<sup>3</sup> This redshift independence makes the tSZ effect an exceptionally powerful tool for studying the universe at high redshifts. While the CMB photons themselves are subject to redshifting as they travel across vast cosmic distances, the energy boost they receive from scattering off the hot electrons in galaxy clusters effectively compensates for this effect. Consequently, galaxy clusters at high redshifts are, in principle, just as easily detectable through the tSZ effect as those at lower redshifts, provided that the angular resolution of the observations is sufficient to resolve the clusters. This unique property distinguishes the tSZ effect from many other astrophysical probes, whose signals diminish with increasing distance.

### Physical Processes Behind the tSZ Effect

The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect arises from a fundamental interaction between the low-energy photons of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the high-energy electrons present in the hot, ionized gas of the intracluster medium (ICM).<sup>2</sup> As CMB photons traverse the vast expanse of a galaxy cluster, they have a small but finite probability, estimated to be around 1% for photons passing through the center of a massive cluster, of encountering an energetic electron within the ICM.<sup>9</sup> The dominant scattering mechanism in this interaction is inverse Compton scattering.<sup>5</sup> In this process, which is the reverse of the more common Compton scattering, the high-kinetic-energy electrons transfer a portion of their energy to the lower-energy CMB photons.

This energy transfer results in a systematic increase in the average energy of the scattered CMB photons. The average fractional change in the frequency of a scattered photon is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron temperature of the ICM.<sup>10</sup> This relationship underscores the direct connection between the thermodynamic state of the ICM and the characteristics of the tSZ effect. The hotter the electron gas in the cluster, the greater the energy boost imparted to the CMB photons during scattering.

The cumulative effect of countless such scattering events as CMB photons pass through the ICM is a distinct spectral distortion of the CMB radiation.<sup>1</sup> The CMB spectrum, which is initially a blackbody spectrum, is shifted towards higher frequencies. This shift manifests observationally as a decrement in the intensity of the CMB at frequencies below approximately 218 GHz and an increment in intensity at frequencies above this point.<sup>1</sup> The shape of this spectral distortion is well-defined in the non-relativistic regime, where the electrons' velocities are significantly less than the speed of light. However, for the most massive and hottest galaxy clusters, where electron velocities can approach relativistic speeds, the shape of the distortion becomes dependent on the electron temperature, and relativistic corrections to the basic tSZ spectrum must be considered.<sup>9</sup> This unique frequency dependence is a crucial identifier of the tSZ effect, allowing it to be distinguished from other anisotropies in the CMB and from various astrophysical foreground emissions.

It is important to differentiate the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect.<sup>1</sup> While both are consequences of CMB photons scattering off electrons, their origins differ. The tSZ effect arises from the random thermal motion of electrons within the hot gas of galaxy clusters. In contrast, the kSZ effect is caused by the bulk motion, or peculiar velocity, of the entire electron population (and thus typically the entire galaxy cluster) relative to the rest frame of the CMB.<sup>1</sup> The kSZ effect imparts a Doppler shift to the scattered CMB photons, resulting in a change in the observed CMB temperature that has the same spectral form as the primordial fluctuations in the CMB.<sup>10</sup> This spectral similarity makes the kSZ effect more challenging to separate from the primary CMB anisotropies. Furthermore, in typical galaxy clusters, the amplitude of the kSZ effect is generally smaller than that of the tSZ effect.<sup>8</sup> While both the tSZ and kSZ effects provide valuable information about the properties of the scattering medium, the tSZ effect is often the dominant signal associated with galaxy clusters and serves as a primary tool for studying their thermodynamics.

### Cosmological Applications of the tSZ Effect

The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect has emerged as a powerful tool with a wide range of applications in cosmology, significantly enhancing our understanding of the universe's composition, evolution, and large-scale structure.

#### Detection of Galaxy Clusters

One of the primary cosmological applications of the tSZ effect is its ability to detect and locate galaxy clusters, particularly at high redshifts.<sup>1</sup> The unique redshift independence of the tSZ effect means that the signal strength from a galaxy cluster of a given mass and temperature remains relatively constant regardless of its distance from us.<sup>3</sup> This is in stark contrast to other methods of detecting galaxy clusters, such as through their optical light or X-ray emission, where the observed flux decreases significantly with distance. Consequently, tSZ surveys are exceptionally effective for finding new galaxy clusters in a way that is largely unbiased by redshift.<sup>5</sup> Several large-scale surveys, including the South Pole Telescope (SPT), the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and the Planck satellite, have leveraged the tSZ effect to discover thousands of massive galaxy clusters extending to high redshifts.<sup>5</sup> Furthermore, the angular size of galaxy clusters as observed from Earth changes relatively little for clusters between redshifts of approximately 0.3 and 2, which further facilitates their detection in tSZ surveys.<sup>5</sup> This capability has been instrumental in building comprehensive catalogs of galaxy clusters, which are essential for various cosmological studies.

#### Measuring Cluster Properties

The tSZ effect also provides a means to measure several key physical properties of galaxy clusters.<sup>1</sup>

**Determining Cluster Temperature and Pressure**

The tSZ effect is directly proportional to the integrated thermal pressure of the electrons along the line of sight through the galaxy cluster.<sup>3</sup> This makes it a sensitive probe of the hot gas within the cluster. Furthermore, relativistic corrections to the tSZ spectrum exhibit a dependence on the electron temperature of the ICM.<sup>20</sup> By observing the tSZ effect at multiple frequencies, particularly those sensitive to these relativistic corrections, it becomes possible to directly measure the temperature of the hot gas. Combining tSZ data with observations of the cluster's X-ray emission provides an even more powerful approach to studying the thermal structure of the ICM, allowing for the determination of both the temperature and density profiles.<sup>5</sup> The tSZ effect, therefore, offers a direct measure of the thermal energy content of the ICM.

**Estimating Cluster Mass**

The integrated tSZ signal over the angular extent of a galaxy cluster is related to the total thermal energy of the hot electrons within it.<sup>6</sup> Since the thermal energy is expected to correlate with the cluster's gravitational potential and thus its mass, the tSZ effect can be used to estimate the mass of galaxy clusters. Crucially, scaling relations between the integrated tSZ effect (often denoted as Y\<sub>SZ\</sub>) and the cluster mass (M) have been established.<sup>8</sup> These scaling relations are vital for cosmological studies that rely on the abundance of galaxy clusters. They can be calibrated using a combination of hydrodynamical simulations, which model the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters, and other observational data, such as weak gravitational lensing measurements that provide independent estimates of cluster masses.<sup>24</sup> The tSZ effect, therefore, provides an independent and valuable way to weigh these massive cosmic structures.

#### Studying Large-Scale Structure

The distribution and properties of galaxy clusters detected through the tSZ effect serve as powerful probes of the large-scale structure of the universe.<sup>3</sup> Because the abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of their mass and redshift is highly sensitive to the underlying cosmology, particularly to parameters such as the matter density of the universe and the amplitude of matter clustering, surveys of tSZ-detected clusters can be used to constrain these fundamental parameters.<sup>5</sup> Furthermore, by cross-correlating the tSZ effect with other cosmological tracers, such as maps of gravitational lensing or the distribution of galaxies, it is possible to recover information about the redshift of the structures and gain insights into the distribution of baryonic matter throughout the universe.<sup>3</sup> The tSZ effect also offers a promising avenue for probing the warm/hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), a diffuse component of the universe thought to harbor a significant fraction of its baryons.<sup>3</sup> By tracing galaxy clusters and this diffuse hot gas, the tSZ effect contributes significantly to our mapping of the universe's large-scale structure.

### Astrophysical Applications of the tSZ Effect

Beyond its significant cosmological applications, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect serves as a crucial tool in astrophysics, providing unique insights into the formation, evolution, and composition of galaxy clusters and the distribution of hot gas in the universe.

#### Evolution of Galaxy Clusters

The tSZ effect plays a vital role in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters over cosmic time.<sup>1</sup> By probing the hot, ionized gas within clusters, the tSZ effect allows astronomers to study the thermodynamic state of the intracluster medium (ICM), including its temperature and pressure profiles.<sup>8</sup> These profiles are influenced by various physical processes that occur during cluster formation and evolution, such as mergers with other clusters or groups, and feedback processes driven by galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) residing within the cluster. Comparing tSZ observations with the predictions from numerical simulations of galaxy cluster formation and evolution is crucial for testing and refining our theoretical models.<sup>16</sup> Furthermore, the tSZ effect can provide insights into the presence and magnitude of non-thermal pressure support within galaxy clusters, which is an important factor in accurately determining their total mass.<sup>36</sup> Overall, the tSZ effect serves as a vital tool for unraveling the complex astrophysical processes that govern the evolution of these massive cosmic structures.

#### Distribution of Hot Gas

The tSZ effect is also instrumental in mapping the distribution and properties of hot gas not only within galaxy clusters but also in the broader intergalactic medium (IGM).<sup>1</sup> As the tSZ effect is sensitive to the integrated electron pressure, it acts as an effective tracer of the hot, ionized gas.<sup>3</sup> By performing statistical analyses and stacking tSZ data towards the locations of known galaxies and galaxy groups, astronomers can investigate the average properties of the hot gas associated with these halos, including the circumgalactic medium (CGM) that surrounds galaxies.<sup>38</sup> The tSZ effect offers a unique advantage in studying this hot gas component, which can be challenging to observe through other means, such as optical emission, due to its low density and high temperature. Therefore, tSZ observations provide a valuable avenue for understanding the distribution of the universe's baryonic matter in its hot, ionized phase, both within and beyond the confines of galaxy clusters.

### Significance of the tSZ Effect in Understanding the Universe

The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect holds immense significance in advancing our understanding of the universe across various aspects, including its composition, evolution, and fundamental parameters.<sup>1</sup>

#### Contribution to Our Knowledge of the Universe's Composition

The tSZ effect provides a crucial means of probing the hot, ionized baryons that reside in galaxy clusters and the intergalactic medium (IGM).<sup>3</sup> These hot baryons are thought to constitute a significant fraction of the total baryonic matter in the universe. Measurements of the tSZ effect can help constrain the baryon density parameter of the universe, a fundamental parameter that describes the proportion of ordinary matter in the cosmos.<sup>22</sup> By allowing us to observe the hot gas in these structures, the tSZ effect contributes to addressing the "missing baryons" problem, as a substantial fraction of the universe's baryons are theorized to exist in the form of a low-density warm plasma within the IGM, which is effectively probed by the tSZ effect.

#### Insights into the Universe's Evolution and the Growth of Structures

The abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of their mass and redshift, which can be effectively determined through tSZ observations, is highly sensitive to the growth of structure in the universe.<sup>5</sup> This growth is governed by cosmological parameters such as the nature and density of dark energy. By studying the properties of galaxy clusters at different epochs using the tSZ effect, we can gain valuable insights into how these massive structures form and evolve over cosmic time.<sup>1</sup> The tSZ effect, therefore, provides a window into the universe's dynamic evolution, allowing us to test our understanding of how gravity and other fundamental forces shape the cosmos by observing the distribution and properties of galaxy clusters, the largest virialized objects in the universe.

#### Constraints on Fundamental Cosmological Parameters

The tSZ effect plays a crucial role in refining our understanding of the fundamental properties of the universe by providing constraints on key cosmological parameters.<sup>1</sup> When combined with other cosmological probes, such as primary CMB anisotropies, weak gravitational lensing, and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), tSZ data contribute to tighter and more robust constraints on these parameters.<sup>3</sup> For instance, the tSZ effect can be used to independently estimate the Hubble constant, a measure of the universe's expansion rate, by combining tSZ and X-ray data to determine the angular diameter distance to galaxy clusters.<sup>5</sup> Furthermore, the amplitude of the tSZ power spectrum, which describes the statistical fluctuations in the tSZ signal across the sky, is particularly sensitive to the amplitude of density fluctuations in the universe (denoted as σ\<sub>8\</sub>) and the overall matter density (Ω\<sub>m\</sub>).<sup>31</sup> This sensitivity makes tSZ power spectrum measurements a valuable tool for constraining these fundamental cosmological parameters, often providing independent or complementary constraints to those derived from other observational methods, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive and robust cosmological model.

### Limitations and Challenges in Observing the tSZ Effect

Despite its significant scientific potential, observing the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect presents several limitations and challenges.<sup>1</sup>

#### Weakness of the tSZ Signal and the Need for Highly Sensitive Instruments

The tSZ effect manifests as a very small distortion in the CMB, typically at the level of microkelvins.<sup>3</sup> Detecting and mapping such a faint signal necessitates the use of highly sensitive detectors and telescopes that operate at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, where the spectral signature of the tSZ effect is most prominent.<sup>1</sup> The inherent faintness of the tSZ signal means that sophisticated instruments and long observation times are often required to achieve a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for meaningful measurements.

#### Foreground Contamination from Other Astrophysical Sources

Observations of the tSZ effect are susceptible to contamination from other astrophysical sources that emit radiation at similar frequencies.<sup>3</sup> These foregrounds include emissions from radio galaxies, dusty galaxies that contribute to the cosmic infrared background (CIB), and thermal emission from dust within our own Galaxy. The amplitudes of these foreground emissions can often be significantly larger than the tSZ signal itself, particularly at certain frequencies. Therefore, sophisticated component separation techniques are essential to disentangle the tSZ signal from these contaminating sources. These techniques often rely on the fact that the CMB, the tSZ effect, and various foregrounds have distinct spectral properties, allowing them to be separated based on observations at multiple frequencies.<sup>3</sup> Additionally, point sources, such as individual radio and infrared-emitting galaxies, can contaminate tSZ measurements of galaxy clusters, potentially biasing estimates of cluster properties.<sup>21</sup>

#### Challenges in Separating the tSZ Signal from the Primary CMB Anisotropies and the kSZ Effect

On large angular scales, the primary anisotropies in the CMB are significantly stronger than the tSZ effect, making it challenging to isolate the tSZ signal in these regimes.<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, which arises from the bulk motion of electron populations, has a spectral dependence that is very similar to that of the primary CMB fluctuations.<sup>10</sup> This spectral similarity makes it difficult to separate the kSZ effect from both the primary CMB and, to some extent, the tSZ effect. Multifrequency observations are often employed to exploit the subtle spectral differences between the tSZ and kSZ effects, allowing for their separation through careful data analysis.<sup>1</sup> Disentangling these various CMB signals requires sophisticated analysis techniques to avoid confusion and ensure accurate interpretation of the tSZ data.

#### Impact of Relativistic Corrections on the tSZ Spectrum

For the most massive and hottest galaxy clusters, the velocities of electrons in the ICM can become a significant fraction of the speed of light, leading to relativistic effects that modify the shape of the tSZ spectrum.<sup>9</sup> These relativistic corrections are particularly noticeable at higher electron temperatures, causing a shift in the null frequency of the tSZ effect, where the intensity change is zero.<sup>9</sup> Accurate modeling of these relativistic corrections is crucial for obtaining precise measurements of cluster temperatures and for performing reliable cosmological analyses using high-mass clusters.<sup>9</sup> Neglecting these corrections can lead to biases in the estimation of cluster properties, particularly temperature, and consequently affect cosmological inferences. Therefore, high-precision studies of the tSZ effect, especially those focusing on the most extreme galaxy clusters, must carefully account for these relativistic effects.

### Recent Research and Discoveries Using the tSZ Effect

Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in our understanding of cosmology and astrophysics thanks to observations and analyses of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect.<sup>2</sup>

One notable area of progress is the high-significance detection of relativistic corrections to the tSZ effect.<sup>20</sup> These detections have allowed for more precise measurements of the temperatures of galaxy clusters, providing valuable insights into the thermodynamics of the intracluster medium. For example, statistical analyses of tSZ spectral distortions in large galaxy cluster samples have yielded significant detections of these relativistic effects, consistent with temperatures inferred from X-ray observations.<sup>20</sup>

Measurements of the tSZ power spectrum and galaxy cluster counts from large-scale surveys like Planck, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) have continued to refine our constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters.<sup>21</sup> These studies often reveal tensions or consistencies with parameters derived from other cosmological probes, such as primary CMB anisotropies and weak lensing, prompting further investigation into the underlying cosmological model and the physics of galaxy clusters. Recent analyses of Planck data, for instance, have provided updated all-sky Compton parameter maps of the tSZ effect, leading to refined measurements of the tSZ angular power spectrum and cosmological constraints.<sup>31</sup>

Research has also focused on studying the pressure profiles and scaling relations of galaxy clusters using tSZ data.<sup>20</sup> These studies aim to improve our understanding of the physical processes within clusters and to refine the relationship between observable quantities like the integrated tSZ signal and fundamental properties like cluster mass, which is crucial for cosmological analyses based on cluster abundance. For example, stacking analyses of tSZ data from Planck have provided insights into the gas pressure in low-mass galaxy groups.<sup>51</sup>

The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect has also been a subject of recent research, with the first definitive detection of the kSZ effect signature in the CMB being reported.<sup>2</sup> These measurements provide information about the peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters and the distribution of diffuse plasma in the universe.<sup>2</sup>

Cross-correlation studies involving the tSZ effect and other cosmological probes, such as gravitational lensing and galaxy surveys, have become increasingly important.<sup>3</sup> These studies help to probe the distribution of baryons in the universe, constrain cosmological models, and potentially resolve tensions between different cosmological datasets. For instance, cross-correlations of tSZ maps with gravitational lensing maps from Planck and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey have been used to detect warm and diffuse baryons in large-scale structure.<sup>51</sup>

Ongoing and recently completed surveys like the SPT, ACT, and Planck have been instrumental in these discoveries. The SPT has continued to expand its catalog of galaxy clusters detected via the tSZ effect <sup>5</sup>, while ACT has also made significant contributions to tSZ cluster catalogs and power spectrum measurements.<sup>5</sup> The Planck satellite's all-sky tSZ map and power spectrum have provided a wealth of data for numerous cosmological and astrophysical investigations.<sup>3</sup>

### Observational Experiments and Techniques for tSZ Mapping

The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect is observed using a variety of telescopes and instruments that operate in the millimeter and submillimeter wavelength ranges.<sup>1</sup> These instruments include ground-based radio telescopes, interferometers, and large millimeter and submillimeter telescopes equipped with sensitive bolometer arrays.

Radio telescopes and interferometers, such as the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) and the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array, which operated at frequencies around 30 GHz, have been instrumental in obtaining early images of the tSZ effect in individual galaxy clusters.<sup>5</sup> These interferometers provided high angular resolution, allowing for detailed studies of the central regions of clusters.

Large millimeter and submillimeter telescopes, like the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), are equipped with large arrays of highly sensitive bolometers that operate at frequencies such as 90 GHz, 150 GHz, and 220 GHz.<sup>1</sup> These ground-based telescopes offer high sensitivity and large fields of view, making them particularly well-suited for conducting wide-area surveys to detect large numbers of galaxy clusters through their tSZ signature. The Planck satellite, which operated from space, provided an all-sky survey with a broad range of frequency channels from 30 GHz to 857 GHz, enabling the creation of an all-sky map of the tSZ effect.<sup>3</sup>

tSZ maps are typically obtained from the raw observational data, which contain a mixture of the CMB, the tSZ signal, and various foreground emissions, by employing sophisticated component separation techniques.<sup>31</sup> These techniques, such as the Internal Linear Combination (ILC), MILCA (Maximum Internal Linear Combination Analysis), NILC (Needlet Internal Linear Combination), and ABS (Analytical Blind Separation) methods, leverage the unique spectral signature of the tSZ effect – its characteristic frequency dependence – to distinguish it from other components.<sup>31</sup> By carefully combining data from multiple frequency channels, these methods aim to isolate and reconstruct a map of the Compton y-parameter, which is directly related to the integrated thermal pressure and thus the strength of the tSZ effect. For cosmological analyses, the angular power spectrum of these tSZ maps is often computed, and cross-power spectra between different frequency maps or between tSZ maps and maps from other cosmological probes are used to minimize the impact of noise and systematic effects.<sup>31</sup>

The field of tSZ research continues to advance with current and upcoming experiments. The Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 are next-generation CMB experiments that promise to deliver significantly increased sensitivity and resolution.<sup>24</sup> These future experiments are expected to provide even deeper and wider surveys of the tSZ effect, as well as more precise measurements of the tSZ power spectrum and individual galaxy clusters, which will undoubtedly lead to further breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe.

### Overall Importance and Impact of the tSZ Effect

The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect stands as a unique and exceptionally powerful tool for studying the cosmos.<sup>1</sup> Its independence from the redshift of the source makes it an invaluable probe for investigating the high-redshift universe and the evolution of galaxy clusters throughout cosmic time.<sup>3</sup> The tSZ effect offers a direct means of probing the thermal pressure of the hot gas within galaxy clusters, enabling measurements of crucial properties such as temperature, pressure, and mass.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, tSZ surveys have proven to be highly efficient in detecting large samples of galaxy clusters, which are essential for cosmological studies aimed at understanding the formation and evolution of large-scale structure.<sup>1</sup> The tSZ effect has fundamentally revolutionized our ability to study the universe's most massive structures and their evolution across cosmic history.

The power of the tSZ effect is further amplified by its complementarity to other observational probes in both cosmology and astrophysics.<sup>1</sup> Combining tSZ data with observations in the X-ray regime provides a particularly potent means of investigating the thermodynamic properties of the ICM and even estimating the distances to galaxy clusters.<sup>5</sup> Additionally, cross-correlating tSZ maps with maps derived from gravitational lensing and galaxy surveys yields valuable additional information about the distribution of matter and baryonic components within the universe.<sup>3</sup> The tSZ effect, therefore, is most effective when integrated into multi-wavelength and multi-messenger approaches to studying cosmic phenomena, providing a unique perspective that complements and enhances the insights gained from other observational techniques.

Looking towards the future, the prospects for tSZ research are exceptionally bright, with significant advancements anticipated from ongoing and planned next-generation experiments.<sup>24</sup> Upcoming CMB experiments, boasting enhanced sensitivity and angular resolution, promise to enable even more precise measurements of the tSZ effect.<sup>24</sup> This will lead to improved constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters and a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the physics governing galaxy clusters. These future instruments will also aim to achieve better separation of the tSZ and kSZ effects and to probe the distribution of hot gas throughout the universe with unprecedented detail.<sup>24</sup> The continued exploration of the tSZ effect through these advanced observational capabilities holds the potential to unlock new discoveries and further refine our picture of the cosmos.

### Conclusions

The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect has firmly established itself as an indispensable tool in modern cosmology and astrophysics. Its unique spectral signature and redshift independence provide a powerful means to detect and study galaxy clusters, the universe's largest bound structures, across cosmic time. By measuring the tSZ effect, scientists can determine crucial properties of these clusters, such as their temperature, pressure, and mass, offering vital insights into their formation and evolution. Furthermore, the distribution of tSZ-detected clusters and the diffuse hot gas they trace serve as valuable probes of the large-scale structure of the universe, contributing to our understanding of its composition and the fundamental parameters that govern its expansion and evolution.

While observing the tSZ effect presents challenges, including the weakness of the signal and contamination from other astrophysical sources, ongoing advancements in detector technology and data analysis techniques continue to push the boundaries of what is achievable. Recent research has demonstrated the power of the tSZ effect in refining cosmological constraints, studying the thermodynamics of galaxy clusters, and even probing the distribution of the universe's "missing" baryons. The future of tSZ research is particularly promising, with next-generation CMB experiments poised to deliver even more precise and comprehensive data, which will undoubtedly lead to further breakthroughs in our quest to understand the universe. The tSZ effect, therefore, remains a cornerstone of observational cosmology and astrophysics, offering a unique and vital perspective on the cosmos.
