# Crowrite

Stress-free note-taking by git

## Usage

Someday, I will add a markdown file and record what I have learned. This markdown file will begin with date and each subtitle tell me what catogory the text belongs to. I will search the context by using simple grep command or ctrl+shift+f in vscode-like text editor.

## Learn deeper

I create this repo mainly to remember more things because my memory is terrible, so I will add some memory algorithm to this repo in the future.

## Identifier

inside \[ ] is the flag of the content:

* EASY/MEDIUM/HARD/VERY HARD
* different major categories of subjects
* knowledge point small type

To ease the recording, difficulty level can be ignored

* COMPUTER
  * PYTHON LEARNING
  * HTML LEARNING
  * MARKDOWN LEARNING
* NOTES
* QUOTES
* METHODOLOGY

MEMO: Be careful and might be useful in the future.

BRAINSTORM: Write down your unmature idea. Although it's possible that it's just a whim, who knows?

WHY: Ask everything. No one know everything but one can ask everything.
