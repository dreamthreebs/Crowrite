# Crowrite
Stress-free note-taking by git
## Usage
Someday, I will add a markdown file and record what I have learned. This markdown file will begin with date and each subtitle tell me what catogory the text belongs to.
I will search the context by using simple grep command or ctrl+shift+f in vscode-like text editor.
## learn deeper
I create this repo mainly to remember more things because my memory is terrible, so I will add some memory algorithm to this repo in the future.
