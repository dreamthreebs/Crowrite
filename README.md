# Crowrite

Stress-free note-taking by git

## Usage

Someday, I will add a markdown file and record what I have learned. This markdown file will begin with date and each subtitle tell me what catogory the text belongs to.
I will search the context by using simple grep command or ctrl+shift+f in vscode-like text editor.

## Learn deeper

I create this repo mainly to remember more things because my memory is terrible, so I will add some memory algorithm to this repo in the future.

## Identifier

inside [ ] is the flag of the content:

* EASY/MEDIUM/HARD/VERY HARD
* different major categories of subjects
* knowledge point small type

To ease the recording, difficulty level can be ignored

## Categories
the following categories could be searched.
* COMPUTER
* NOTES
* QUOTES
* METHODOLOGY
* HTML LEARNING
* MARKDOWN LEARNING
* PAPER
* MATH
* CMB

CROW is the category that you can write without considering the subcategories, so it is relaxing to write.

MEMO is the category that you should be careful and might be useful in the future.

BRAINSTORM is the category that you can write down your unmature idea. Although it's possible that it's just a whim, who knows?

WHY is the category that you can ask everything. No one know everything but one can ask everything.
